What is the time complexity of the following code snippet

int func(int n){

int s = 0;

for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i = i * 2){

s = s + i;

}

return s;

}


Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(n)
B) O(n^(1/2))
C) O(logn)
D) O(∞)

Ans:D) O(∞)
Explaination: The answer is O(∞).
The loop is an infinite loop as the value of i initialized with 0 doesn't change on multiplication by 2
