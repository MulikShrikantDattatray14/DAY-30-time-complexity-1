If for an algorithm time complexity is given by O((3/2)^n) then complexity will:

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) constant
B) quardratic
C) exponential
D) none of the mentioned

Ans:C) exponential
Explaination: Explanation: The growth rate of that function will be exponential therefore complexity will be exponential.
