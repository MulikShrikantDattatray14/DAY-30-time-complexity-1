What is the time complexity of the following code snippet

int func(int n){

int s = 0;

for(int i = 1 ; i <= 100 ; i++){

s = s + i;

}

return s;

}

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(n)
B) O(n^2)
C) O(s)
D) O(1)


Ans: D) O(1)
Explaination : The answer is O(1). 
The loop runs for 100 times.
