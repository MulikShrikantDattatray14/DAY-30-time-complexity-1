What is the time complexity of the following code snippet

int func(int n){

int s = 0;

for(int i = 1 ; i*i*i <= n ; i++){

s = s + i;

}

return s;

}

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(n^(1/4))
B) O(n^(1/3))
C) O(n^(1/2))
D) O(n)

Ans:B) O(n^(1/3))
Explaination :The answer is O(n^(1/3)).
The loop runs for cube root of N times.
